# Demo Project

This is a minimal React application.

## Theme Toggle

Open the **Settings** section of the app to switch between light and dark mode. Enabling dark mode applies a `dark` class to the page's `<body>` element so Tailwind CSS can activate its dark color scheme. The selection is saved in `localStorage` and restored when you revisit the site.
